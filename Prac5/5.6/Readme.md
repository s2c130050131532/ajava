Working with sessions
In any web application user moves from one page to another and it becomes necessary to track the user data and objects throughout the application. JSP provide an implicit object "session", which can be use to save the data specific to the user. 
In this practical we will create an application that takes the user name from the user and then saves into the user session. We will display the saved data to the user in another page.
